                    <h5>Enchantment cantrip</h5>
                    <p>Casting time: 1 action<br>
                        Range: 30 ft.<br>

                        Duration: 1 round<br>
                        <br>
                        Choose a target within range. After shouting something that could cause panic, such as "did you leave the oven on?", the target makes a wisdom saving throw. On a fail the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and has no control over their movement on their turn for the duration.<br>
                        On their turn, roll a d4, on any number but a 4 the target uses all their movement to move in the direction of a way to end their panic. The target wouldn't obviously run into anything harmful, like falling into a pit. The creature still can use their action and bonus action as their nature would imply.<br>
                        A target who can't hear or understand you automatically succeeds the saving throw.<br>
                        A target who succeeds the saving throw is immune to that phrase to cause panic for 24 hours.<br>
                        <br>
                        When you reach levels 5, 11, and 17 the psychic damage increases by 1 die: 5(2d4), 11(3d4), and 17(4d4).<br>

                        Upon putting the dirt in the water (both in spells components) you summon a 20 ft radius sphere of mud within range. Any creature in the sphere's space must succeed a dex saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage or half as much on a successful one. The ground in the space of the sphere then becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Moving through the space requires 4ft for each 1ft moved instead of 2.<br>

                        <b>Using a higher-level spell slot:</b> For every spell slot above 1st increase the damage by 1d4 and at certain slot levels the radius increases size: 4th (30ft), 7th (40ft).<br>

                        You choose a creature (including yourself) or spot in range and a magic weapon below of your choice appears. If you pick a creature the weapon appears in their hand(s). The weapon exists for the duration, until dismissed as a bonus action, or the weapon is farther than 1 mile from the caster.<br>

                        <br>
                        For the purpose of resistance and immunity the weapons attacks are magical, adamantine, and silvered.<br>
                        If you choose a creature and they don't have the necessary hands free, the weapon appears in the creature's space on the ground.<br>

                        <br>
                        When you are targeted with an attack or spell that does a damage type other than radiant, necrotic, poison, or psychic, you do a magic infused acrobatic move reducing the damage by 5d8 + your spell casting modifier and you gain resistance to that attack type until the start of your next turn.<br>
                        If an attack does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to trigger this it only gives you resistance to nonmagical attacks of that type.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you cast this spell using a 6th level spell slot or higher the amount reduced increases by one die for each slot above 5th.<br>

                        You call upon animals to come and attack your foes.<br>
                        Animals come and fill a 30ft sphere within range. Any creature of your choice within the circle makes a dex saving throw, taking 2d6 piercing, 2d6 slashing, and 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a fail. On a success, it instead takes half damage.<br>
                        If a creature fails by 5 or more it is knocked prone and takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage.<br>
                        Whenever a creature starts their turn within the sphere, they must succeed another dex saving throw or take 2d6 piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage (your choice when you cast the spell).<br>
                        If there aren't enough animals within a mile (at the DM's discretion) the slot is expended, the spell fails, but the material components are not consumed.<br>
                        <br>
                        For every slot above 5th, one of the initial damages increases by 1d6 (your choice).<br>

                        If it is included in an area of effect, it appears to just succeed saving throws from it and remain unharmed.<br>
                        If it is targeted with an attack roll or a spell that targets creatures directly, the spell seems to work but the creature remains unaffected.<br>

                        <br>
                        17-18 You lose all your money, but if you succeed a dexterity saving throw against your own spell DC it takes all of the money of a random creature within 60 ft of you.<br>
                        <br>
                        19-20 You fart so loud anyone within 10ft behind you takes 8d10 thunder damage.<br>

                        23-24 Roll 2 more times rerolling any 23 or 24 doing both of them.<br>

                        31-32 A blue turtle shell with wings falls from the sky at a point of your choice exploding upon contact. Every creature within 30 ft of the point of contact makes a Dex saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage, 4d10 force damage and has the stunned condition on a fail.

                        33-34 Roll a d20, a slim Jim appears in your hand (or if your hands are full it appears in your backpack) the length of your roll, in feet. Each foot long it is, counts as 1 ration.<br>

                        39-41 Roll on the 22 cards column in the deck of many things table doing what it says as if you drew the card.<br>

                        43-44 It starts raining, and continues to do so as long as you are awake. Once you go to sleep this effect ends.<br>

                        45-46 You sneeze really loudly (audible out to 1 mile), losing your action on this turn (or if this the initial roll when you cast this, it's your next turn).<br>
                        <br>
                        47-48 For the next 5 rounds, if you take a specific action you aren't allowed to take that action again.<br>

                        51-52 Your bones become liquid changing your creature type to ooze. This effect has no effect if you are an ooze already. This effect is only reversible by wish.<br>
                        <br>

                        65-66 You lose any 1 feat you have of your choice (including ability score improvement), and gain a different feat of the same type (origin, general, fighting style, epic boon) for which you qualify.<br>

                        <br>
                        71-72 A random item in your possession (DM decides what) disappears and is replaced with another item (DM still decides) that shares some aspect (such as both being potions, martial weapons, or requiring attunement). If the removed item is a magic item, the replacement must be the same rarity or higher. If you succeed a DC 17 dexterity saving throw, this instead happens to a random other creature within range.<br>
                        <br>
                        73-74 Roll a d4; if you roll a 4, roll on the artifact's major beneficial properties table. If you roll a 3, roll on the minor beneficial properties table. If you roll a 1 or  2, roll on the artifact's minor detrimental properties table. The result lasts for 1 hour (rather than when you are attuned to an artifact). If the result has anything to do with distance between you and the artifact, reroll. If the result lets you cast a spell, you instead just cast a spell of said level (spell determined by DM).<br>
                        <br>
                        75-76 A clone of yourself appears at an unoccupied spot within range. It acts and functions the same as you, taking its turn directly after yours in combat.

                        <br>
                        87-88 A random magic item that you are attuned to disappears from your inventory and appears in a random other creature's inventory (within range). The creature whose inventory it appears in instantly attunes to it. If the creature who receives the magic item doesn't fulfill requirements, choose a different creature. If you have no magic items requiring attunement, nothing happens.<br>
                        <br>
                        89-90 Make a DC 24 wisdom saving throw; on a fail you become addicted to alcohol as described in the <a class="interpage" href="magicItems.html#Potion_of_Alchoholism">potion of alcoholism</a>.<br>

                        91-92 Pick a spell, then roll a d10; if the roll on the d10 is higher than the spell's level (not equal), you cast it. If you pick a cantrip you cast it no matter what.<br>
