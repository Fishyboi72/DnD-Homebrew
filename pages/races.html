                            <br>
                            <b>Construct:</b> You are a sentient suit of armor, you do not age like normal living beings. You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition and you are also immune to disease. You do not need to eat, drink or breathe. You also cannot be targeted by spells that target humanoids like hold person or cure wounds. You also do not sleep, but rather you stay in an inactive state for 4 hours a day, during this time you are fully aware of your surroundings.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Mendable:</b> Whenever the spell mending is cast on you, regain 1d6+ spell casting ability hit points.<br>

                            <br>
                            <b>Soul Transfer:</b> You can transfer your consciousness into another suit of armor over the course of a short or long rest. During that time you perform an hour-long ritual. Over the course of that hour, you must remain within 5 feet of the armor, or the ritual fails. This change may alter your subrace accordingly, based on the desired armor type. If you are not proficient in the armor you transfer yourself into, you will receive all the detriments that someone normally would by wearing a set of armor they are not proficient with, as well as a -2 penalty to your Armor Class.<br>

You can make a creature not proficient in your armor type proficient while wearing you, you can also make them experience the detriments as if they are not. As an action, you can force an unwilling creature you are grappling to wear you, make another grapple check, on a success you force them to wear you.<br>

                        <h3>Animated Baby Doll</h3>
                        <p><b>Ability score increase:</b><br>
                            Increase your dexterity score by 2 and your charisma score by 1.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Alignment:</b><br>
                            Just like a normal baby, baby dolls are highly unpredictable and tend toward chaotic alignments.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Size:</b><br>
                            You're an animated doll, your size is tiny.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Darkvision:</b><br>
                            You have 60ft of darkvision<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Created, Not Born:</b><br>
                            You were a doll animated by magic, therefore you are a construct, not a humanoid. Because of this, you do not age. Also, you are unaffected by spells that target humanoids such as hold person and crown of madness. You are also immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Unfortunately healing spells like cure wounds do not work on you. Because you are a construct, you also do not need to eat, drink, breath, or sleep. Instead of sleeping, you must remain in an inactive state for 4 hours a day to gain the benefits of a long rest, remaining conscious and alert to danger during this time.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Mendable</b><br>
                            When a creature casts mending on you, they can expend one spell slot, causing you to regain 2d8 hit points per spell slot level expended. If you have 0 hit points you also become stable.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Did that doll just move?</b><br>
                            While completely motionless, you are indistinguishable from a normal doll.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Holy crap that doll is fast:</b><br>
                            Unlike a human baby, baby dolls are quite fast for their size, you have a walking speed of 30 ft and crawling does not cost you extra movement.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Skill proficiencies.</b><br>
                            You are proficient in perception and intimidation.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Languages:</b><br>
                            You can speak, read and write common and one other language that your creator spoke.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Trapped Soul: </b></p>
                            <h6><i>(At DM's Discretion)</i></h6>
                            <p>Your life force is not tethered to your body, even when your body dies, your soul lives on. If you die, a creature can place your head (assuming it's intact) near a body-like object (ex: suit of armor, headless body) and cast mending, expending a 3rd level, attaching your head to the object. The object then becomes your new body, if this object is made of organic matter, it can no longer decompose until you die.</p>

                        <h3>Harambe</h3>
                        <p>Harambes started out as a normal group of gorillas, but over time they grew in intelligence, then a harambe cast the mage hand cantrip and used it to grab a banana out of a tree. After this point the intelligence of the species grew dramatically as well as their expertise of the mage hand cantrip. Eventually they learned how to become quadrupedal using the cantrip. As their intelligence grew, their society developed nearly as quickly. A society with not so much rules as an understanding of what is, and what isn't allowed. Harambes live in tribes though they are not as solid as most species tribes are as harambes are allowed to freely move between tribes, so small tribes act as towns and large tribes act as cities. When a harambe does something that is believed as wrong they must have 2 accusers, if there are 2 accusers, then the accusers and defendants must each write an essay to plead their case, send it to the people of the tribe, then write one more essay in response to the opposing side's essay and send it to the people of the tribe. One week after the second essay has been released, any who wish may vote for which side they believe more, if the accusers win, then the tribe elders choose a punishment, otherwise the defendants are free to go.<br>

                        <h3>Cloud Elf (2014)</h3>
                        <p>Living in cities and palaces made of clouds in just about anywhere in the material plane and the elemental plane of air. Cloud elves are very mistaken for air genasi by anyone who hasn't seen either, but are obviously elves to others. Sometimes a cloud elf colony is close to a tall mountain they generally then have good relations with or even live with aarakocra or goliaths. Occasionally you can find a cloud elf run monastery with a few non cloud elves. If a cloud elf lives away from a cloud elf society they prefer secluded lives or in a small cloud elf group.<br>
                            Cloud elves tend to have white or gray toned skin with white, gray or black hair. Their eyes are generally blue or green. Cloud elves are very slim and rarely weigh more than 100 pounds.<br>

                            Weapon training<br>
                            Unlike regular elves cloud elves prefer only ranged weapons.<br>
                            You have proficiency with the shortbow, longbow, and all crossbows (light, hand, and heavy).<br>
                            At the DM's discretion you also can have proficiency in all guns.<br>
                            <br>
                            Slow falling<br>
                            When you are falling you can cast levitate on yourself, descending only. You can use this feature twice per long rest.<br>

                            Background<br>
                            Cloud elves either have a background relating to being secluded or from a big city.<br>
                            <br>
                            Alignment<br>
                            Cloud elves tend toward neutral alignments for being part of their own civilizations. They tend not to have many relationships with other races or even other elf subraces.</p>
