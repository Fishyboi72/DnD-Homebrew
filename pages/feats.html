                    <h5>Prerequisite: Strength Score of 15 or Higher</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While you are wielding an axe, it gains the thrown property with a range of 20/60.</li>
                        <li>When you throw an axe, you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, making separate attack rolls for each target. The damage dealt by the attack is halved for each creature after the first. In addition, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.</li>

                    <h3>FEET!!!</h3>
                    <h5>Prerequisite: have at least one foot</h5>
                    <p>This is the worst feat you could possibly pick. All it does is double the amount of feet you have. The new feet can do nothing except wear shoes. They grow out of your shoulders. You can take this feat multiple times. Apply previous times of taking this feat's feet. The second time the feet come out of your knees. The third time they come out of your hips. The fourth time they come out of the backside of your head. The fifth time they come out of your elbows. Unless you have special armor for your new feet you cannot wear armor. The feet are so distracting that every extra foot you have your charisma goes down by 1. If your DM is feeling nice this also adds 5 ft to your movement speed or adds one to your dexterity score every time you take it.</p>

                    <h3>Perfect Dodge</h3>
                    <h5>Prerequisite: dex 16 or higher</h5>
                    <p>When an enemy misses an attack on you by 8 - your proficiency or more, you can make a dexterity check. If your check is higher than the attack roll of the attacker you can use your reaction to make a number of attacks depending on what you use as shown below. An attack roll of a 1 automatically triggers this.<br>
                        <br>
                        Any martial melee weapon: 1<br>
                        Any simple melee weapon: 2<br>
                        An unarmed strike: 3<br>
                        <br>
                        If it is an improvised weapon, either the DM decides how many or it's always 1.<br>
                        This does not work when you are attacked with or attack with a ranged spell, a spell that requires a saving throw,  or a ranged weapon.</p>

                    <h3>Pristine Dodge</h3>
                    <h5>Prerequisites: Perfect Dodge, dex 18 or higher</h5>
                    <p>You can perfect dodge an opportunity attack or a perfect dodge attack.
                        You also can do 1 more attack with your weapon.<br>
                        Any pristine dodge successful against a perfect dodge attack causes the other attacks to miss.</p>

                        <b>10th slot.</b> You gain a 10th level spell slot, which can be used for upcasting spells to that slot. For example, fireball does more damage at higher level slots; if you use your 10th level slot, it would do 15d6 fire damage.</p>
