                    <h4>3rd Level: Resourceful</h4>

                    <h4>3rd Level: Monkey Mad</h4>
                    <p>You can go into a monkey rage when you rage, doing so causes your body to transform into that of a large monkey. For the duration of your rage, you gain the following benefits;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your size increases to Large</li>
                        <li>You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>However the transformation makes it hard for your monkey brain to understand how to use modern weapons. While you are raging, you do not add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with martial weapons.</p>
                    <h4>6th Level: Monkey Fists</h4>

On a failed save, the target is stunned until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.<br>
                        While you are raging, you now deal double damage to objects and structures.
                        Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.</p>
                    <h4>10th Level: Monkey Make a Noise</h4>
                    <p>When you enter a Monkey Rage, you can let out a loud and intimidating Monkey noise. Every hostile creature within 30 ft of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Monkey save DC. Creatures that succeed their save suffer no effects. Creatures that fail their save become frightened for 1-minute. Frightened creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. This feature can be used once per short or long rest.</p>

                        <b>Movement of the Planes:</b><br>
                        Difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. Additionally, you can spend half your movement speed to exit any non-magical restraints.<br>
                        <b>Mastery of the Planes:</b><br>
                        Whenever you hit an attack with a weapon you have mastery with, you can use any other mastery property instead.</p>
                    <h4>Level 10: Otherworldly Attacking</h4>
                    <p>At 10th level, while you are raging you are a weapon master; all weapon attacks you make use a die size up (d6 to d8 and d8 to d10 and so forth), if it is a d12 use 2d6 instead of a d20. For a weapon that already uses more than one die, increase just one. Your unarmed strikes now do a d4. Additionally, you can now wield two handed weapons in just one hand.</p>
                    <h4>Level 14: Planar Presence</h4>
                    <p>At 14th level, when you rage (lasting for the duration of the rage), you can gain one of the following effects:<br>
                        <b>Planar Immunity:</b><br>
                        You take on a form as an aspect of the plane. You have immunity to the damage type associated with the plane you chose.<br>
                        <b>Planar Doom:</b><br>
                        Every creature of your choice within 30 ft of you must succeed a dex saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and your proficiency bonus) or take a number of d4s of the damage associated with the plane you chose equal to your rage bonus. You can use a bonus action on your turn to cause this again.<br>
                        <b>Pain of the Plane:</b><br>
                        Any damage you do of the type associated with the plan you chose is doubled.<br>
                        <br>
                        You can use this feature one time per long rest unless you expend a use of your rage to restore it (no action required).</p>

                    <h5>Monk Subclass</h5>
                    <p>Warriors of the Wild have embraced nature and harness it to cast spells, protect people, and even unleash its wrath on people. It is a unique subclass that is a ⅓ caster not using the wizard spell list.</p>
                    <h4>Level 3: Spellcasting</h4>
                    <p>You have learned to cast spells from embracing nature.<br>
                        <b>Cantrips.</b> You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. <i>Thunderclap</i> and <i>Thorn Whip</i> are recommended. <br>
                        When you reach Monk level 10, you learn another cantrip from the Druid spell list.<br>
                        <b>Spell Slots.</b> The Warrior of the Wild Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

                        The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warrior of the Wild Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Monk, your list of prepared spells can include five Druid spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.<br>

On your turn (no action required) you can convert Ki / Focus Points into spell slots; expending the required amount of points into a slot of that level. You cannot have more spell slots than your maximum of that level.<br>
                        You can also expend a spell slot of that level to gain points equal to the cost. You still cannot have more than your maximum. You cannot create a slot you don't have already (e.g. you cannot make 4th Level slots until you are 19 level).</p>

                    <h4>Level 11: Nature's Shield</h4>
                    <p>When you or an ally within 30 ft of you is hit with an attack, you can use a reaction and expend 4 Ki / Focus Points to make a plant shield appear in front of that creature. The plant shield grants +5 to AC until the start of your next turn, potentially turning a hit into a miss. If any creature hits the target while they have the shield with an attack, the attacker takes 2d10 piercing damage.</p>
                    <h4>Level 17: Wrath of Nature</h4>
                    <p>Whenever you hit a melee attack with a Monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can invoke nature's wrath. You expend 7 Ki / Focus Points and the target of the attack takes an additional 4d10 piercing damage, as vines whip them. If the target is large or smaller, the target then has to make a strength saving throw (DC equals your spell DC). If the target fails, the target is then restrained. If the target succeeds, is huge or is gargantuan, it takes an additional 2d10 piercing damage. A restrained creature takes 1d10 piercing damage at the start of each of their turns, and can make a strength (athletics) check against your spell DC, freeing itself on a success.</p>

                    <p>Whenever you gain a Monk level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Druid spell for which you have spell slots.<br>
                        Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.<br>
                        You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.</p>
                    <h4>Level 3: Nature's Points</h4>
                    <p>You gain an additional amount of Ki/Focus points equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
                    <h4>Level 6: Nature's Obscuration</h4>
                    <p>Whenever you hit a melee attack with a Monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can expend 2 Ki/Focus points to cause the target to make a dexterity saving throw (DC equals your spell DC) or have the blinded condition. Additionally, you gain +2 AC against that creature until the start of your next turn.</p>
                    <h4>Level 11: Nature's Shield</h4>
                    <p>When you or an ally within 30 ft of you is hit with an attack, you can use a reaction and expend 4 Ki / Focus Points to make a plant shield appear in front of that creature. The plant shield grants +5 to AC until the start of your next turn, potentially turning a hit into a miss. If any creature hits the target while they have the shield with an attack, the attacker takes 2d10 piercing damage.</p>
                    <h4>Level 17: Wrath of Nature</h4>
                    <p>Whenever you hit a melee attack with a Monk weapon or an unarmed strike, you can invoke nature's wrath. You expend 7 Ki / Focus Points and the target of the attack takes an additional 4d10 piercing damage, as vines whip them. If the target is large or smaller, the target then has to make a strength saving throw (DC equals your spell DC). If the target fails, the target is then restrained. If the target succeeds, is huge or is gargantuan, it takes an additional 2d10 piercing damage. A restrained creature takes 1d10 piercing damage at the start of each of their turns, and can make a strength (athletics) check against your spell DC, freeing itself on a success.</p>

                    <h5>Master of none</h5>
                    <p>Characters who are a Jack of all trades have a little skill in everything. They're heavy skill monkeys and have lots of variety in features and techniques for battle. Jack of All Trades comes with a lot of choices, so indecisive people could take forever to make a character with this class.<br>
                        <br>
                        <i>Note: some features refer to the artificer; the artificer I used was the Unearthed Arcana one from the 2024 rules. The parentheses name is the 2025 Unearthed Arcana name. If you want to use those but not the Unearthed Arcana, consult your DM. It is suggested you then use the equivalent feature from the Tasha's Cauldron of Everything artificer.</i></p>

                        For features like Skills in all Classes, you cannot pick features you already have, even if it's from a different class; except for the spell casting feature: treat it as if this class was the class giving the spellcasting feature and use the spellcasting multiclass rules.</p>
