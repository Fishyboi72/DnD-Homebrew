                    <h5>Simple melee weapon, artifact (requires attunement)</h5>
                    <p>The Master Sword is a +3 shortsword that on a hit does 9d6 slashing damage and 1d10 radiant damage.<br>
                        Damage dealer: Any creature who has vulnerability to any damage from the Master Sword (slashing, radiant, or the Master Sword altogether), multiply the damage they have vulnerability to by 3 instead of 2.<br>
                        Immunity ignorer: it is impossible to have immunity to the Master Sword. If a creature has immunity, treat it as resistance.<br>
                        Magic reflection: while holding the Master Sword you get resistance to spells and advantage on spell saving throws.<br>
                        The Master Sword is an ornate shortsword with the decoration of the triforce on the part where the guard meets the handle. The Master Sword glows occasionally when anything with the chaotic evil alignment or powerful magic (any artifact, or 9th level spell taking effect) is within 60 ft.<br>
                        Proficiency with a shortsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus with attack rolls made with it.</p>

                    <h3>The Permafrost Blade</h3>
                    <h5>Weapon (artifact)</h5>
                    <p>This dagger has a finely crafted handle made of a deep blue leather-like substance. The blade of the dagger resembles a blue obsidian and glows a dim blue, casting dim light for 2.5 feet. The temperature of the blade is always below 0 degrees. While unsheathed, this dagger decreases the temperature of the air within 5 feet of it by 30 degrees and 10 degrees for an additional 5 feet, however the blade cannot cause the air around it to be colder than the blade itself. This dagger deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit. A target hit by this blade must make a constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your attack roll, taking (1d6)d6 cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. If you roll 6d6 for damage, the creature's movement speed is halved until the end of your next turn. If you score a critical hit with this dagger, the creature is stunned until the start of your next turn. If you roll a 20 on an attack roll and deal 6d6 damage in the same attack, the target is petrified in unmeltable ice until greater restoration or similar magic is cast on it.  If you roll a 1 on the attack roll, make a DC 13 constitution saving throw, on a failed save you take (1d6)d6 cold damage and you gain one level of exhaustion. On a successful save you take half as much damage and do not gain a level of exhaustion. If you fail the saving throw by 10 or more, you become petrified in unmeltable ice until greater restoration or similar magic is cast on you.</p>
