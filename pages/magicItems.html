                    <h3>The Ring of Ultimate Despair</h3>
                    <h5>Ring (artifact), requires attunement</h5>
                    <p>Nobody is sure who crafted this ring but speculation is that Vecna made it. It looks like the Ring of Ultimate Luck and seems to be even if identify is cast on it. The only way to destroy the Ring of Ultimate Despair is for a creature attuned to both it and the Ring of Ultimate Luck to throw both in a sphere of annihilation.<br>
                        While attuned to this ring, your luck is terrible. Your unluckiness is also put on others nearby.<br>
                        Any time you roll a 2 on a d20 roll consider it a 1. You have disadvantage on death saving throws.<br>
                        This ring has 13 charges regaining all charges at dawn each day. As a bonus action you can expend 1-4 charges, giving every creature in 5 * charges expended ft of you disadvantage on any check, saving throw (including death saving throws), and attack they make until the end of your next turn.<br>
                        As a reaction you can expend 1 charge to give a creature disadvantage on a d20 roll.<br>
                        If you expend all 13 charges in one day, roll a d10, and on any number but a 10, the ring expels a magic force dealing 8d10 force damage to you and every creature within 10ft of you. This damage cannot be reduced or negated in any way.<br>
                        Cursed: you cannot end your attunement to this ring. Your attunement ends only if the ring is destroyed, wish is cast to end it, or you die.<br>

                    <h3>The Ring of Ultimate Luck</h3>
                    <h5>Ring (artifact), requires attunement</h5>
                    <p>Fish Stick first crafted this ring from the bones of an ancient gold dragon, using his ring of evasion for the basis of its magic. There are 2 ways to destroy the Ring of Ultimate Luck. One is to get an ancient gold dragon to eat a creature attuned to and wearing it. The other is to have a creature attuned to both the Ring of Ultimate Luck and the Ring of Ultimate Despair throw both rings in a sphere of annihilation.<br>
                        This ring has 7 charges and gains 1d4+3 at dawn each day. While wearing this ring you can expend 1 charge to gain advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw or 2 charges if you fail any check or saving throw to succeed instead. You can also use a reaction to expend 2 charges and cast silvery barbs.<br>
                        Whenever you hit an attack you can expend 1 to 3 charges rerolling an amount of damage dice equal to the amount of charges expended. You must use the new roll of each die.<br>
                        Moreover, if you ever roll a 72 on a d100, you instead can expend 1 charge and decide what result to use instead.
                        Furthermore, while wearing this ring you gain +2 to all saving throws (including death saving throws).

                    <p>Choose a direction and press a button on the rod; the rod will move in that direction at 5ft every 6 seconds. While the rod is activated, a DC 30 Strength(athletics) check is required to stop it. Otherwise the rod may be moved in any direction perpendicular to the direction it is moving. If the Unstoppable rod contacts an immovable rod, a black hole is formed sucking all items within 10 ft of the rod into the astral sea. Both rods are destroyed upon contact and a sphere of annihilation appears in its place. The rod can be deactivated by clicking the button on its handle again.</p>

                        Damage dealer: Any creature who has vulnerability to any damage from the Master Sword (slashing, radiant, or the Master Sword altogether), multiply the damage they have vulnerability to by 3 instead of 2.<br>

                    <h5>Weapon (artifact)</h5>
                    <p>This dagger has a finely crafted handle made of a deep blue leather-like substance. The blade of the dagger resembles a blue obsidian and glows a dim blue, casting dim light for 2.5 feet. The temperature of the blade is always below 0 degrees. While unsheathed, this dagger decreases the temperature of the air within 5 feet of it by 30 degrees and 10 degrees for an additional 5 feet, however the blade cannot cause the air around it to be colder than the blade itself. This dagger deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit. A target hit by this blade must make a constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your attack roll, taking (1d6)d6 cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. If you roll 6d6 for damage, the creature's movement speed is halved until the end of your next turn. If you score a critical hit with this dagger, the creature is stunned until the start of your next turn. If you roll a 20 on an attack roll and deal 6d6 damage in the same attack, the target is petrified in unmeltable ice until greater restoration or similar magic is cast on it.  If you roll a 1 on the attack roll, make a DC 13 constitution saving throw, on a failed save you take (1d6)d6 cold damage and you gain one level of exhaustion. On a successful save you take half as much damage and do not gain a level of exhaustion. If you fail the saving throw by 10 or more, you become petrified in unmeltable ice until greater restoration or similar magic is cast on you.</p>

                    <p>After you finish a long rest, all stat blocks in the book disappear, effectively resetting its total max CR. Whenever you take a short rest, you can make an int check (DC 13 plus CR) to try to memorize a stat block. You can look at a memorized stat block whenever without meta-gaming. A creature can only have 1 stat block memorized at a time.<br>
                        A creature that has the legendary resistance feature can expend a use of it to avoid being put in the book. When a creature does this, when calculating the max CR total, treat it as if it was put in the tome.</p>
