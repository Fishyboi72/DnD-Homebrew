                    <h2>Alternative Swimming</h2>
                    <h5>Minor change</h5>
                    <p>Like normal rules, unless you have a swimming speed, your speed swimming is half your speed. Alternatively, if you have on heavy armor and don't have a swimming speed, your speed swimming is instead a third of your speed. Likewise, if you wear heavy armor you don't have training / proficiency with, but have a swimming speed, your speed swimming is still halved.</p>
                    <p>If you're wearing heavy armor underwater, you have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws, but have advantage on strength saving throws to stay in place.</p>
                    <p>Weapon underwater rules are the same but are ignored if you are standing on something.</p>
                    <p>Any amount of cold damage over 20 done to a 5 foot cube of water causes it to freeze for 1 round. The cube has AC 10, and 15 hp.</p>
                    <p>The resistance to fire damage rule is the same.</p>

                <article id="altUpcast">
                    <h2>Alternative Upcasting</h2>
                    <h5>Moderate change</h5>
                    <p>Using higher level spell slots to cast spells can do more than just increase the power of a spell but it can also allow for less precise casting techniques to successfully cast a spell, allowing for faster casting of a spell. As normal, you can use the upcasting rules designated in a spell's description but you can also upcast to increase the speed of casting a spell. When you cast a spell you can cast it 2 levels higher, doing so will turn an action spell into a bonus action spell, a bonus action spell into a reaction (opportunity attack unless the DM states otherwise) spell, or turn a reaction spell into a free action spell. This type of upcasting does not increase the potency of a spell, but you can still use standard upcasting alongside quickening upcasting. You can use quickening upcasting multiple times on the same cast.</p>
                    <p>For example, using this feature to upcast Fireball to 6th level to cast it as a bonus action and boost its damage to 9d6.</p>

                <article id="navalCombat">
                    <h2>Naval Combat</h2>
                    <h5>Major ruleset</h5>
                        <h4>INITIATIVE</h4>
                        <p>To determine which ship goes first in combat, whichever side made the first move starts combat, if you are not sure, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the players go first, on a 4-6 the enemies go first. (If there are more than 2 ships, roll initiative like normal, using the creature with the highest initiative bonus’ bonus as the initiative bonus for the ship.)</p>
                        
                        <h4>ACTIONS IN COMBAT</h4>
                        <p>Each PC can either take a normal turn or a crew action on their turn. The ship gets additional crew actions based on how well manned it is.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A fully manned crew (all crew slots filled) gains +3 crew actions.</li>
                            <li>A well-manned crew (75% of crew slots filled) gains +2 crew actions.</li>
                            <li>An undermanned crew (50% crew slots filled) gains +1 crew action.</li>
                            <li>A ship without a crew cannot take crew actions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>DAMAGE CONVERSION</h4>
                        <p>Ships use a different HP and damage system: naval hitpoints (NHP) and naval damage (NDMG). One NHP or NDMG is equivalent to 10 HP or damage.</p>
                        <p>If you deal NDMG to HP, multiply the rolled damage by 10, and if you deal normal damage to NHP, divide the damage by 10 and round down.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ATTACKING SHIPS</h4>
                        <p>When attacking a ship, choose a specific part of the ship to target that is not the hull. Roll to hit the part of the ship you targeted and the hull. The lower roll is to hit the target you chose, while the higher roll is to hit the hull. If you hit the part you targeted, you don’t deal the damage to the hull.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you have advantage on an attack, roll a third die and drop the lowest of the three.</li>
                            <li>If you have disadvantage, do the same, but drop the highest.</li>
                            <li>If you are using an AOE, you automatically hit the hull and roll to hit the part you targeted as normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Ramming:</h5>
                        <p>To ram, the front of your ship (your ram) must be contacting the ship you want to ram. If you are ramming head to head, both ships take (your speed + target’s speed)d4 bludgeoning NDMG. If you are ramming head to side, both ships take (your speed)d4 bludgeoning NDMG. If you are ramming head to back, both ships take (your speed - target’s speed)d4 bludgeoning NDMG.</p>
                        
                        <h4>WEIGHT, SPEED, AND AGILITY</h4>
                        <p>For every 5 weight you have, reduce your speed by 2 and your agility by 1.</p>
                        <p>Every full cargo slot adds 1 weight, and certain upgrades add weight.</p>
                        <p>There are 2 types of cargo slots: storage slots and crew slots. A storage slot can hold 1 ton. A crew slot can hold 10 crew members.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Ship Stats</h4>

                    <p>Retaliation is a feature that can be given to certain powerful monsters, when you give this feature to a monster, increase its CR by 2. Creatures with the Retaliation feature gain the following benefits:</p>

                        <li>When it is targeted by an attack or put inside an AOE effect it gains a retaliation point.</li>
                        <li>For every 10 HP it loses, it gains a retaliation point.</li>
                        <li>It can have a max number of retaliation points equal to half of its CR (minimum of 1)</li>
                        <li>It can spend 1 retaliation point to take a simple action such as making an attack (not using multiattack) or interacting with an object.</li>
                        <li>It can spend 2 or 3 retaliation points, depending on the action, to use a more complex action such as a dragon's breath weapon.</li>
                        <li>It can spend 4 retaliation points to use a multiattack.</li>
                        <li>Retaliation points can be used at the end of any creature's turn</li>
